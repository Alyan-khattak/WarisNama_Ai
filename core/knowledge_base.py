#          Classical Hanafi: Son B's children get NOTHING (blocked by Son A).

# If the sum of all Quranic fixed shares EXCEEDS the estate (i.e., fractions add to > 1),
# all shares are reduced proportionally. This is called Awl.
# ENGINE NOTE: Calculate sum of all fixed fractions. If > 1, multiply each by (1 / total_sum).

#          Apply Awl: each share multiplied by 3/4.

    # surplus is returned to ALL fixed-share heirs including daughters.
    # Unlike Hanafi, even the spouse may benefit from Radd in some Shia interpretations.

Respected Sir,

It is stated that late {deceased_name} passed away on {death_date}.
The legal heirs are: {heirs_list}

This mutation is void under the Succession Act 1925 as no succession certificate
was obtained. We request:
  1. Immediate cancellation / reversal of the illegal mutation
  2. Freezing of the property record pending court order
  3. Registration of our complaint in the official record
